Run the strongly connected components algorithm on the following directed graphs, starting with Node \(A\). Whenever there is a choice of vertices to explore, always pick one that is alphabetically least.

Answer the following questions:

a) In which order are the strongly connected components found?
b) Which are the source and sink SCCs?
c) Draw the meta-graph.
