Devise a divide-and-conquer (recursive) algorithm for adding up all numbers in the array \(A[1â€¦n]\). Your algorithm should divide the array \(A\) into two equal subarrays.

1) Describe your algorithm in a clear pseudocode.
2) Analyze the running time of your algorithm. Prove your answer.

Implementation is Julia programming language.

```julia
function sum(A)
  n = lenght(A)
  if n == 1
    # If the array A has only one element return the element.
    return A[1] # 1-based indexing
  else
    # Otherwise divide the array into equal sized subarrays and
    # then add the sums of the subarrays together.
    mid = div(n, 2)  # Integer division
    return sum(A[1:mid]) + sum(A[(mid+1):end])
  end
end
```

In the running time analysis we assume that operations  `length` and `[]` (indexing and slicing) on arrays are constant time operations. We also assume that addition `+` and integer division `div` of two numbers are constant time operations. The recurrence relation therefore is of form \[T(n)=2 T(n/2) + O(1).\] By using the *master theorem* [@introduction_to_algorithms], the running time of the algorithm is \[T(n)=O(n).\] As we can see, the divide and conquer algorithm for the summation is no better than direct summation term by term.
