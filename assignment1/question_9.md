## Question 9
A **number maze** is an \(n√ón\) grid of positive integers. A token starts in the upper left corner; your goal is to move the token to the lower-right corner. On each turn, you are allowed to move the token up, down, left, or right; the distance you may move the token is determined by the number on its current square . You are never allowed to move the token off the edge of the board.

Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either returns the minimum number of moves required to solve a given number maze, or correctly reports that the maze has no solution.
