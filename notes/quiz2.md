2) There exists a graph \(G\) with \(6\) vertices whose vertex degrees are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5\).

3) In an \(n\)-by-\(n\) grid graph, let \(s\) and \(t\) be any two opposite corner nodes. Then the number of shortest paths from \(s\) to \(t\) is exponential in \(n\).

4) Let \(C\) be a cycle on \(n\) nodes. There are exactly \(n\) non-isomorphic spanning trees of \(C\).

5) There is a bipartite graph that contains a cycle of length \(10211\).

6) Let \(G\) be a graph. Which of the following quantity may increase if an edge is added into graph \(G\)? More formally, what happens if we turn \(G=(V,E)\) into \(G'=(V,Eâˆª\{e\})\).

7) Let \(G\) be a graph. Which of the following quantity may increase if an edge is removed from graph \(G\)? More formally, what happens if we turn \(G=(V,E)\) into \(G'=(V,E-\{e\})\) where \(e\) is an edge in \(G\).
